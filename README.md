## Overview
**Imagica** is a web-based vision board platform designed to help users **set New Year resolutions** and **reflect on them a year later**. Users can sign in using their **Google account**, upload images, and create sticky notes on a digital board—turning goals into a visual, personal experience.

The project focuses on intentional goal-setting, creativity, and long-term reflection.
